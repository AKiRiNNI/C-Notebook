//loop control
//we can diverge from regular loop behavior using
    //break, terminates the loop entirely
    //continue, ends the current iteration and continues with the subsequent iteration

break; //jumps out from loop
continue; //ends current iteration, continue with subsequent one etc: 1, 2, 3; continue at 1, see if continue to 3
